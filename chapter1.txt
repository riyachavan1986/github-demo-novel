Read & underst& the prompt: Know exactly what is being asked of you. It’s a good idea to dissect the prompt into parts.
Plan: Brainstorming & organizing your ideas will make your life much easier when you go to write your essay. It’s a good idea to make a web of your ideas & supporting details.
Use & cite sources: Do your research. Use quotes & paraphrase from your sources, but NEVER plagiarize.
