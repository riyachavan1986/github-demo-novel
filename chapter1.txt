Read and understand the prompt: Know exactly what is being asked of you. It’s a good idea to dissect the prompt into parts.
Plan: Brainstorming and organizing your ideas will make your life much easier when you go to write your essay. It’s a good idea to make a web of your ideas and supporting details.
Use and cite sources: Do your research. Use quotes and paraphrase from your sources, but NEVER plagiarize.
